Mav2GoPro - Control WiFi GoPro using mavlink (drones)

Use an ESP8266 (12E) to connect to a GoPro action camera and control / monitor the gopro in flight (drones) using the mavlink protocol.
Basically this is a setup for the AutoQuad (www.autoquad.org) flightcontroller but with little changes also for other flightcontrollers. 

Be sure to include the mavlink library and set your arduino IDE for using the ESP8266 as board.
